My portfolio highlights my previous experience in other industries and attempts to tie it to how it will make me a successful
web developer.

I have changed the css a bit, added text, added a section where my CV will go, and updated the portfolio page with links
to the work I have done thus far. I would like to format the portfolio page differently, but I'm not certain what it
will look like.
