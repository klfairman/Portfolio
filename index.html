      <br>

      <p>My name is Kristen Fairman and life has taken me in a number of directions. During school I was actively involved in Nordic
        Skiing which taught me the value of hard work and allowed me to travel the world. I was a member of the US Development Team at an early age and raced at the Division 1 level at
        Middlebury College in Vermont. While there I studied Geography, Architectural History and Design, and developed
        a passion for the Russian language.  I spent an enriching summer working for the world reknowned language schools at Middlebury.
        </p>

      <p>After graduation I moved back to Minnesota where I began working as a certified personal trainer while simultaneously 
        pursuing a Master of Arts in Teaching.  Soon thereafter, forgoing a teaching position,
        I moved to Chicago where I completed my Master of Arts in Forensic Psychology and worked as a Data Analyst for The Chicago
        School of Professional Psychology.  Upon returning to Minnesota, I began a doctoral program in Clinical Psychology and worked
        in transitional care for adults with co-morbid chemical dependency and mental illness. While academically interesting, I longed for more from a career than being a psychologist could offer.
        I began to look for other career paths that could combine my passion for language, design, psychology, and creativity.  This is where I find myself
        pursuing coding and web development as my career.</p>

      <p>As a professional I bring ambition, strong work ethic, and ingenuity to the work I produce. As a versatile early career professional, I am a
        creative front and back end developer who is responsive to the needs of clients while integrating a background in psychology, data analysis, elite athletics, and architectural design. A lifelong learner,
        I am commited to practicing my skills and advancing them through practice coding exercises, networking events, and keeping up to date on the current state of the field.</p>
